# DoMusic API

Search and download music directly from the API in a simple way. Data like thumbnail and artist name are tags written in the audio file. The API uses the [Mathiz framework](https://github.com/firlast/mathiz).

## Running API

To run the API, you need to have Python installed and PIP. With these commands, you will install the packages:

```
git clone git@github.com:jaedsonpys/domusic-api.git
cd domusic-api/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> We recommend using `Virtual Environment` for better organization of packages.
